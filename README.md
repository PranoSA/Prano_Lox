# Design Decisions For Prano Languages


Might want to split the Compiler and VM into two seperate things 

## Types -> Strong Typing is Made



## Binding Types 

Environment -> Bindings 
// Look Up By Name 

Bindings[Name] call with type FunctionArguments

Job of the function to check the type of arguments

Extrapolate the value 

And Call Functions Underneath the hood with it 

Prano_Value type 

## Type Inferences ->


## For Loops
for()


## While Statements




## C-Bindings



## Include Statements

## Package Manager


### Where is The Repository 


### Local Installations To Project


### Package.JSON



### Instance Wise Installations



### Get Info About Package



## Build System
